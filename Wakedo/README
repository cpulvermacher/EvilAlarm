Bare-essentials, blazing fast, graphically and usability tested
alarm clock.

Features:
 * a photorealistic vintage alarm clock screen with moving clock hands
 * a red clock hand indicator to show the alarm time when the alarm is on
 * animated transitions to create an illusion of turning the app around to set
   the alarm (somewhat like what you do with a real alarm clock)
 * usability finesse: when user sets alarm time, alarm is automatically turned
   on, too, and time until alarm is shown.

The N900 alarm clock is slow. This is probably due to the fact that it
stores a list of old alarm times, which is completely useless after a
while when the list has grown huge and there is no way to clean it up.
Also, an alarm clock needs no world clock, and need not have system
clock settings like the N900 one does.

(I have not seen the N9/N950/MeeGo alarm clock yet. :)

Create a more iPhone style flippable clock with just the clock on the front
side and on the backside configuration for alarm time
